# "Something" Game
This is an old project from 2022 I found on my drive. When it was developed it was literally called "Something" just because it was being created during my enormously boring time where I had nothing else to do and I needed to stay awake.

## How do i play it?
You can download entire repository and just open index.html in your browser. Have fun for the next 30 seconds until you fall asleep due to no goal in this game and with nothing to do other than to max out your character in the next 10 seconds of gameplay.

## Why is the code so bad?
I was developing it out of boredom and during the time i was learning programming.

Things that I would change/add:
- Document entire codebase with JSDoc
- Improve/Rewrite hitbox system and marks
- Move chunks data to the server, add multiplayer and add billions of ads to yet another clone of agar.io.

Im sure there are more things that need an improvement, but those above are the main ones that come to my mind.

If it was a new game I would probably do it with canvas instead of heavily relying on DOM, but it's a nice demo to show that you can easily make complex games without touching canvas.
